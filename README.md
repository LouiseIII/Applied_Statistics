# Master Course Repository: Applied Statistics

This repository contains projects completed as part of the *Applied Statistics* course during my masterâ€™s program. The course focused on addressing real-world challenges in applied statistics through case studies, using core statistical methods and their extensions, along with computational and problem-solving tools to deliver reproducible solutions. Key topics covered include smoothing, regression analysis, statistical modeling, time series, spatial data, extreme value analysis, and statistical consulting.

## Projects Overview:
1) **Simulation of Snowflake Diameters:** Statistical simulation to model snowflake diameter distributions.
2) **E-commerce Customer Behavior:** Modeling customer purchase probabilities based on web browsing data.
3) **Impact of COVID-19 on Home Advantage in Football:** Statistical modeling of goals scored per game to analyze changes during the pandemic.
5) **Climate Change - Time Series Analysis:** Predicting temperature changes using time series models.
6) **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Applied to COVID-19 data for dimensionality reduction and pattern detection.
